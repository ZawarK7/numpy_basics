Numpy Basics
This repository contains Python code showcasing the fundamental aspects and functionalities of NumPy, a powerful library for numerical computing in Python. NumPy is widely used for handling arrays, mathematical operations, and data manipulation, making it an essential tool for data scientists, researchers, and engineers.

Overview:
1. Array Creation and Manipulation:
Introduction to array creation using NumPy, including generating arrays with zeros, ones, random values, and specific dimensions. Demonstrates operations like reshaping, concatenation, and basic mathematical operations on arrays.

2. Array Indexing and Slicing:
Explains how to access and modify elements in arrays using indexing and slicing techniques. Demonstrates splitting arrays and various indexing methods to retrieve specific elements or subsets of arrays.

3. Array Operations and Functions:
Covers a range of operations and functions available in NumPy, including arithmetic operations, statistical functions, and element-wise mathematical functions. Highlights features like finding unique values and reversing arrays.

4. Saving and Loading NumPy Objects:
Shows how to save and load NumPy arrays to/from files, providing a practical guide for persisting data. Utilizes NumPy's functionalities to store data in different file formats for efficient data handling.

5. Data Visualization with Matplotlib:
Introduces basic data visualization using the Matplotlib library, showcasing how to create line plots and 3D surface plots using NumPy-generated data. Provides a glimpse into visualizing data for analysis and presentation.

Usage:
Each Python script in this repository serves as a standalone tutorial for the respective topic.
Execute the scripts in a Python environment to understand and experiment with NumPy functionalities.
